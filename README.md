This is the old game where you have to break bricks using a ball. The ball can fell only on a platform controlled by the player. This is a simple version with constant speeds of the ball and the platform.
Rules and instructions:
1.) You can control platform right/left using arrow keys, ball must fall on the platform or you lose.
2.) As the time passes score decreases.
3.) Hitting a brick increases score.
4.) You havee to hit all bricks asap.
5.) Each point on the platform adds a specific component of x velocity to the ball.
6.) Use P to pause
Goal is to create train an AI player for this game.
